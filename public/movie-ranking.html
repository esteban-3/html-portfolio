<h1>The Best Movies According to Esteban</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>
    I am no where near as intelligent as the main character, but I think we relate in
    many ways, especially with our background. Growing up, I was surrounded by many
    people who don't value education, and my high school had a small percentage of
    honors and AP students.

<h3>Paprika</h3>
<p>
    Have you watched <i>Inception</i> directed by Christopher Nolan? A lot of that
    was inspired by this animtaed film. As a fan of anime, this animated film is a 
    must.

<h3>Chronicle</h3>
<p>
    I have watched this film over 10 times. I am a huge fan of superpower films,
    and the twist in this film is nothing like I have witnessed before.
